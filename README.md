# Las Vegas Planner

A full Django Las Vegas Planner App with full-CRUD to update, delete, edit the information inside the app. This is built to help people who are planning to Las Vegas, one of the most popular city to travel, to keep track of which hotel and restaurant they want to visit, or for people who already visited to recall their memory!

### Future Enhancements

 - As a user I want to update model to add more details to help people keep track better.
 - As a user I want to update background image to details and edit page to look visibly better and professional.
 - As a user I want to add check-in and out date of travel for more convenience for users to use.
